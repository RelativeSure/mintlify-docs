description: Essential Linux commands that work across all distributions
---

These fundamental commands work across all Linux distributions and form the foundation of command-line interaction.

## Getting Help

Most Linux commands include built-in documentation accessible through the manual system.

<Note>
Not every command has a manual page, but most system commands do.
</Note>

```shell
# View manual page for a command
man <command>

# Quick help for many commands
<command> --help

# Search manual pages by keyword
apropos <keyword>
```

## Directory Navigation & Listing

### List Directory Contents

```shell
# Basic directory listing
ls

# Detailed list with permissions, size, and timestamps
ls -l

# Show all files including hidden ones (starting with .)
ls -la

# Human-readable file sizes
ls -lh

# Sort by modification time (newest first)
ls -lt
```

### Change Directories

```shell
# Change to specific directory
cd /path/to/directory

# Go to home directory
cd
# or
cd ~

# Go up one directory level
cd ..

# Go to previous directory
cd -

# Show current working directory
pwd
```

## File Content Viewing

### Display File Contents

```shell
# Print entire file content to terminal
cat filename

# View file page by page (press q to quit)
less filename

# Show first 10 lines of file
head filename

# Show last 10 lines of file
tail filename

# Follow file changes in real-time (useful for logs)
tail -f filename
```

### File and Directory Operations

```shell
# Create empty file
touch filename

# Create directory
mkdir directory_name

# Create nested directories
mkdir -p path/to/nested/directory

# Copy files
cp source_file destination

# Copy directories recursively
cp -r source_directory destination_directory

# Move/rename files or directories
mv old_name new_name

# Remove files
rm filename

# Remove directories and their contents
rm -rf directory_name
```

## Shell Management

### Viewing Available Shells

```shell
# List all available shells on the system
cat /etc/shells

# Check current shell
echo $SHELL
```

### Changing Your Default Shell

<Warning>
Changing your shell affects your login environment. Make sure the new shell is properly installed and configured.
</Warning>

```shell
# Change shell for current user
chsh -s /path/to/new/shell

# Change shell for specific user (requires sudo)
sudo chsh -s /path/to/new/shell username

# Example: Change to Fish shell
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
```

## System Information

```shell
# Display system information
uname -a

# Show disk usage
df -h

# Show directory size
du -h /path/to/directory

# Display memory usage
