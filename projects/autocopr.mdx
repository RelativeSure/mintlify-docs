- **Package Management**: Automatically updates spec files for COPR package builds
- **Build Automation**: Triggers COPR builds when new versions are detected
- **Status Tracking**: Provides build status badges for monitoring package health

## Supported Packages

The repository includes spec files and automated builds for various categories of tools:

### Development Tools
- **act-cli**: Run GitHub Actions locally
- **lazygit**: Terminal UI for git commands
