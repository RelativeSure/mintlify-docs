## WSL Subnet

<Warning>
Editing the Windows registry can potentially cause system instability if done incorrectly. Always create a backup of the registry before making changes.
</Warning>

To set up a new network in your NAT interface in WSL, you need to edit the registry.
The keys can be found under this path: "Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss".
There are two keys that need to be changed. They can be updated to the following values:
    - NatGatewayIpAddress   = `192.168.0.1`
    - NatNetwork            = `192.168.0.0/24`

Afterwards, you need to restart your PC. When that's done, open a WSL window and check the network interfaces to verify they have been changed to the new network.
